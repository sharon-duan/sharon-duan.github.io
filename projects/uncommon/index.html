                In the beginning, when looking at Uncommon’s brief, we couldn’t figure out what was their pain points until we had our first client meeting with the CEO and product manager. The more we talked, the more we realized that their product is about to change the recruiting and hiring industry with their AI technology,  However, in Uncommon’s database, there are lots of passive job seekers, and those people usually have a low rate of replying emails and take actions. Uncommon came to us hoping that we can investigate and design solutions to help to grow this market. In the meantime, to instigate a way to cut recruiter’s workload and be more efficient to find good matches. Hence, how to make a product more meaningful and efficient to both recruiters and job seekers?

                  <h4>Tone</h4>
                  <p>
                    One of the key to motivate passive job seeker is the tone in the messages and through the product interface. People like <b>caring</b>, <b>warm</b> and <b>human</b> feeling messages. They want to feel <b>trusted</b>, feel like the recruiter really takes  time to draft the email and the new company is really <b>welcoming</b>.

                  <h4>Content</h4>
                  <p>
                    Another important motivator to passive job seeker is the <b>information</b> provided: first in the email, and then through the application process. We will use <b>progressive</b> disclosure strategy to avoid information overload at a specific time. Also, the content needs to be <b>personalized</b> as much as possible.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
            I had a blast working on this design project and I really enjoyed the teamwork. As a job seeker myself, doing research and interviewing other job seekers and recruiters got me deeper understanding on both sides and also the machine learning technology involved. By designing this product, we can help passive job seekers to find better matching and ideal positions; also, for recruiters, this product could help them tremendously reducing workload, yet gain more accurate findings. This product could make the recruiting industry more organic. 
            <br><br>
            However, to make this product even better, I know we need to dig deeper and further by conducting more contextual research, user analysis and usability testing to find new challenges and needs. Also, I need to finish designing a desktop webpage to make this product complete so the entire experience could be more pleasant.
