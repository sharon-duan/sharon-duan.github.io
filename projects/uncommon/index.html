                In the begining, when looking at Uncommon’s brief, we couldn’t figure out what was their pain points until we had our first client meeting with the CEO and product manager. The more we talked, the more we realized that their product is about to change the recruiting and hiring industry with their AI technology,  However, in Uncommon’s database, there are lots of passive job seekers, and those people usually have a low rate of replying emails and take actions. Uncommon came to us hoping that we can investigate and design solutions to help to grow this market. In the meantime, to instigate a way to reduce recruiter’s workload and be more efficient to find good matches. Hence, how to make a product more meaningful and efficient to both recruiters and job seekers?

                  <h4>Tone</h4>
                  <p>
                    One of the key to motivate passive job seeker is the tone in the messages and through the product interface. People like <b>caring</b>, <b>warm</b> and <b>human</b> feeling messages. They want to feel <b>trusted</b>, feel like the recruiter really takes  time to draft the email and the new company is really <b>welcoming</b>.

                  <h4>Content</h4>
                  <p>
                    Another important motivator to passive job seeker is the <b>information</b> povided: first in the email, and then through the application process. We will use <b>progressive</b> disclosure strategy to avoid information overload at a specific time. Also, the content needs to be <b>personalized</b> as much as possible.

                    Uncommon already has a detailed style guide, I chose purple, blue and yellow to be the main color of the new product. Purple means <b>trust</b>, <b>responsibility</b>; yellow is the Uncommon's logo color, blue is its main tabs color.
