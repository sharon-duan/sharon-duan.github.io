              Uncommon connects job seekers and employers through the use of data and intelligence.
              This project aims to open its business to passive job seekers by providing a responsive web app that removes obstacles that stifle the employment process, that motivates them to move forward, and provides tools for recruiters to pre-screen and find talent more efficiently and accurately.

                In the beginning, when looking at Uncommon’s brief, we couldn’t figure out what was their pain points until we had our first client meeting with the CEO and product manager. The more we talked, the more it became clear that their product was about to change the recruiting and human resource industry with their AI technology. However, Uncommon’s database contains a large number of passive job seekers, and those people usually have a low rate of replying emails and take actions. Uncommon came to us hoping that we could investigate and design a solution to help grow this market, as well as instigate a way to cut recruiters' workload and be more efficient to find good matches. Hence our challenge, how to make a product more meaningful and efficient to both recruiters and job seekers?

                We are new to this industry and the technology involved. In order to understand more about the market, we did some research to find out who were the competitors and what they were doing.
                <br><br>
                From the comparison, we found out that there were similar sourcing platforms existing for recruiters, but there was <b>no focus</b> on the job seeker side, especially for <b>passive</b> job seekers.

                We highlighted some features that may potentially help us design for passive job seekers.

                    One of the key to motivate passive job seekers is the tone in the messages and through the product interface. People like <b>caring</b>, <b>warm</b> and <b>human</b> feeling messages. They want to feel <b>trusted</b>, feel like the recruiter really took time to draft his email, and that the company is really <b>worth joining</b>.

                  <p>
                    Another important motivator to passive job seekers is the <b>information</b> provided: first in the email, and then through the application process. We will use the <b>progressive</b> disclosure strategy to avoid information overload at a specific time. Futhermore, the content needs to be <b>personalized</b> as much as possible.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
            I had a blast working on this design project and I really enjoyed the teamwork.
            <br><br>
            As a job seeker myself, doing research and interviewing other job seekers and recruiters got me a deeper understanding of both sides of this market, and helped me develop my research and design skills.
            <br><br>
            By pushing myself to deliver the best design that I could, I discovered more about my own capabilities, my attraction for detail oriented visuals and interactions alike, and it grew my passion for creating delightful experiences.
