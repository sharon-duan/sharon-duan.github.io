              As air travel frequency keeps growing nowadays, airline companies are trying their best to bring the most out of their services. Delta Airline serves more than 180 million travelers, and they wanted to utilize new technologies such as app or website to facilitate customers using or ordering in-flight services and amenities, to create the best air travel experience.

                Currently the in-flight services are 1) manual (food and drink service, summoning an attendant), 2) dependent on the built-in-technology (movies, music, games, maps), or abstract (wifi, SkyMall). Before we started to design, there were several things to consider: What in-flight services would benefit from being made digital? What in-flight services might users best engage with before boarding the plane? Or once on the plane? How should users pay for premium services (wifi, alcohol)? How do the innovations impact the existing built-in screens?

              <h4>Problem</h4>
              Passengers on long-haul flights often have <strong>trouble to summon</strong> an attendant, don’t know which items and services are <strong>available</strong>, and suffer from <strong>long delivery times</strong> to their requests. When it’s not convenient to get in and out of their seats, they often <strong>give up and wait</strong> for an attendant to pass by. And while they rest, they still <strong>need to be alert</strong> if they want to get food or drinks when they are being served.
              <br><br>
              The built-in screen is <strong>hard to use</strong> (for instance to switch between current time, sky map, or entertainments), and the screen is often of <strong>poor quality</strong>, which make many prefer to use their own devices during the flight.

Their overall in-flight experience will be upgraded with <strong>seamless services</strong> and <strong>efficient payment</strong>, which both satisfy Delta’s business goals and its users needs.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
            As the project manager of this team, I learned how to assign tasks, how to manage time, how to make a decision and how to make the best out of team collaboration. We managed to sythesize a good amount of data and designed 3 different flows in a style consistent with the original application.
            <br><br>
            To make this product complete, we would need to design a convenient and efficient payment system and do more usability testing. As a moderate flyer myself, I know how much this In-Flight service app would greatly improve flyers experiences.
