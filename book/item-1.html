							In the begining, when looking at Uncommon’s brief, we couldn’t figure out what was their pain points until we had our first client meeting with the CEO and product manager. The more we talked, the more we realized that their product is about to change the recruiting and hiring industry with their AI technology,  However, in Uncommon’s database, there are lots of passive job seekers, and those people usually have a low rate of replying emails and take actions. Uncommon came to us hoping that we can investigate and design solutions to help to grow this market. In the meantime, to instigate a way to reduce recruiter’s workload and be more efficient to find good matches. Hence, how to make a product more meaningful and efficient to both recruiters and job seekers?

				<h3>Problem & solution statement</h3>

				<div class="orange-card">
					<h4>Problem</h4>
					<div>
						Passive job seekers often ignore recruiter emails because they are impersonal, vague and require too much time and effort.
						<br><br>
						In order to motivate passive job seekers to explore and pursue new job opportunities, Uncommon needs to offer an experience that is personalized and user-friendly.
					</div>
					<h4>Solution</h4>
					<div>
						Create a <strong>customized experience</strong> for passive job seekers that inspires them to explore new job opportunities with Uncommon.
						<br><br>
						We achieve this by providing a <strong>simple and personalized</strong> applicant process that enables the user to <strong>quickly scan</strong> company details, <strong>qualify</strong> for the position, and <strong>schedule a time</strong> to discuss next steps, all in a matter of minutes.

				<h3>Design Strategy</h3>

				<table class="table-1">
					<tr>
						<td><h4>Tone:</h4></td>
						<td>
							One of the key to motivate passive job seeker is the tone in the messages and through the product interface. People like caring, warm and human feeling messages. They want to feel trusted, feel like the recruiter really takes  time to draft the email and the new company is really welcoming.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><h4>Content:</h4></td>
						<td>Another important motivator to passive job seeker is the information povided: first in the email, and then through the application process. We will use progressive disclosure strategy to avoid information overload at a specific time.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><h4>Color:</h4></td>
						<td>Uncommon already has a detailed style guide, I chose purple, blue and yellow to be the main color of the new product.</td>
