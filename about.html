          <strong>User Experience Designer</strong>

        <p>What is design to you? To me, it’s part of communication; a tool to convey ideas and solve problems. Design is a language, which is most valuable when intuitively understood and appreciated by the user. I believe in balance in everything and I feel lucky to call myself an experience designer.</p>
        <p>My keen interest in design started when I was a little girl. I loved to design clothes for my barbie dolls. I drew sketches on paper and learned how to use a sewing machine from my grandmother. Although I didn’t become a fashion designer, design never left my life. Visual design, infographic design and website design were often involved in my professional work and I always found myself being immersed and serene when designing.</p>
        <p>I realized that I love to help people solving problems when I was in elementary school. I could easily understand and explain my classmates’ confusion points. My academic background was public relations and communication, culture and technology, with a minor in asian studies and international development. In my undergraduate studies, I chose public relations because I love the challenge of solving a company’s crisis, of branding its image, and of establishing its public reputation. As a continuation, I chose international communication, culture and technology to be my graduate studies. I found it fascinating to solve problems using technology, no matter if it is business communication, political campaigns, or regional, national well-being development.</p>
        <p>I love challenge and I’m adventurous. I’m a travel enthusiast. I love both city and nature. I love to explore ancient places and learn their rich history. The more exotic, the more I embrace it. I love to challenge myself by extreme sports. So far, my favorite one is parallel gliding. I have lived in 3 contries and 7 cities. Those experiences not only have tremendously helped developing my design, but also seeded faith in me: there is no absolute in life.</p>
        <p>I treat teamwork seriously and I make sure to finish work on time (even if it requires me sitting for the whole day and overnight). I have the instinct of seeking perfection. I design clean, simple and easy to use experience. I have a natural design thinking mindset rooted in me after all my professional training. I appreciate the beauty of bringing logic and meaning to mess and confusion.</p>
        <p>If I’m not working, I probably plan my next travel, or enjoy myself cooking, hiking, or visiting museums. I like to practice yoga daily, and gain more knowledge about all kinds of tea and its traditional chinese ceremony.
