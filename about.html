        <p>What is design to you? To me, it’s part of communication; a tool to convey ideas and solve problems. Design is a <b>language</b>, which is most valuable when <b>intuitively understood</b> and appreciated by the user. I believe in balance in everything and I feel fortunate to call myself an experience designer.</p>
        <p>My keen interest in design started when I was a little girl. I loved to design clothes for my dolls. I drew sketches on paper and learned how to use a sewing machine from my grandmother. Although I didn’t become a fashion designer, design never left my life. Visual design, infographic design and website design were often involved in my professional work and I always found myself being <b>immersed</b> and <b>serene</b> when designing.</p>
        <p>I realized that I love to help people <b>solving problems</b> when I was in elementary school. I could easily understand and explain my classmates’ confusion points. My academic background was public relations and communication, culture and technology, with a minor in Asian studies and international development. In my undergraduate studies, I chose public relations because I love the <b>challenge</b> of solving a company’s crisis, of branding its image, and of establishing its public reputation. As a continuation, I chose international communication, culture and technology to be my graduate studies. I found it fascinating to solve problems using technology, including business communication, political campaigns, and regional, national well-being development.</p>
        <p>I love challenge and I’m <b>adventurous</b>. I’m a travel enthusiast. I love both city and nature. I love to explore ancient places and learn their rich history. I love challenging myself with extreme sports. So far, my favorite one is paragliding. I have lived in 3 contries and 7 cities. Those <b>experiences</b> not only have tremendously helped developing my design, but also seeded faith in me: there is no <b>absolute</b> in life. If I’m not working, I’m probably planning my next trip, or am enjoying cooking, hiking, or visiting museums. I like to practice yoga daily, and learn more about traditional Chinese tea ceremony and all kinds of tea.</p>
        <p><b>I treat teamwork seriously and I make sure I finish work on time (even if it requires me to work overnight). I have the instinct of seeking perfection. I design clean, simple and easy to use experience. I have a natural design thinking mindset rooted in me after all my professional training. I appreciate the beauty of bringing logic and meaning to mess and confusion.</b></p>
