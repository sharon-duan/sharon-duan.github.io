        <p>What is design to you? To me, it’s part of communication; a tool to convey ideas and solve problems. Design is a <b>language</b>, which is most valuable when <b>intuitively understood</b> and appreciated by the user. I believe in balance in everything and feel fortunate to call myself an experience designer.</p>

        <p>My keen interest in design started when I was a little girl. I loved to design clothes for my dolls, draw sketches on paper, and learn how to use a sewing machine from my grandmother. Although I didn’t become a fashion designer, design never left my life. Visual design, infographic design and website design were often involved in my professional work and I always found myself being <b>immersed</b> and <b>serene</b> when designing.</p>

        <p>I realized how rewarding it felt to help people <b>solve their problems</b> during my elementary school. I could easily understand my classmates’ struggles, and clear their confusion. My academic background was Public Relations and Communication, Culture and Technology, with a minor in Asian Studies and International Development. In my undergraduate studies, Public Relations was my first choice because of my attraction to the <b>challenge</b> of solving a company’s crisis, of branding its image, and of establishing its public reputation. As a continuation, I picked International Communication, Culture and Technology to be my graduate studies. I found it fascinating to solve problems using technology, including business communication, political campaigns, and regional, national well-being development.</p>

        <p>New challenges attract me and I define myself as <b>adventurous</b> and a true travel enthusiast, with an equal love for city and nature. Exploring ancient places and learn their rich history feeds my curiosity. I love challenging myself with extreme sports; so far, my favorite one is paragliding! I have lived in 3 contries and 7 cities. Those <b>experiences</b> not only have tremendously helped me develop my design, but also seeded faith in me: there is no <b>absolute</b> in life. If I’m not working, I’m probably planning my next trip, or enjoying cooking, hiking, or visiting museums. I like to practice yoga daily, and learn more about traditional Chinese tea ceremony and all varieties of tea.</p>
